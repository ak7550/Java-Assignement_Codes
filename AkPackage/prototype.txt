massive changes are necessary in Array.java class

we have learnt so much new things

int[] arr = list.stream().mapToInt(Integer::valueOf).toArray()
String[] array = list.toArray(new String[list.size()]);
Integer[] array = list.toArray(new Integer[list.size()]);

Use generics in InputOutput T plays both the role of BufferedReader and FileReader

thinking of making a file system in this cases to store teh test cases accordingly, so that while calling file name, we can take all the testcases at once and do the fun stuff, just calling them one by one

function should be able to figure out who is calling it, so that it can make the file with same name accordingly
    addANewTestCase() method should be there, so that it increment the number of the testcases and add the testcase too. ==> done


a function to write data in a text file of same name.
    what kiind if data it's ==> ArrayList if String
